* Julian: You canâ€™t remove an event handler if the function is anonymous
* Joe: FlexBox theory with 60% success rate!
* Charles: Power of arrays for data - so much data generated, the power to manipulate w/ arrays.
* Ben: I like Javascript? Had a bad time learning independendtly, but having instruction & a cohort it's fun! CSS is improving _daily_.
* Maximo: Constructor functions are great to simplify creating anything you want! This career field has great collaboration.
* ChrisB: Code comes from a collaboration, not just your peers but also the amount of published code on the internet (and how much failure is progress!)
* Megan: Debugging w/ Inspect tool. So many ways to figure out what's going on, with JS in the console, Elements for HTML/CSS.
* Herman: Value of extensions, useful in making shortcuts. ESLint showing where errors are before running the code.
* Jordan: How frustrating CSS can be, but getting better with it. And having help from peers, TAs, online resources.
* Mehtab: The creativity behind problem solving in code. The concept (and assignments) are the same, but the solutions vary so much!
* Cianenry: Rubber Duck Programming - up late, finishing code, with no one else up that late I can talk to my "rubber duck" to see what I wasn't seeing.
* Sage: Add & Append elements to the page, the handshake between JS & HTML.
* Chris: The sheer number of features HTML & CSS added since the 90s. We just used tables, but what we have now is amazing. So much easier.
* Erik: For loops, while loops, utilizing & getting to know them better. I enjoy the front end, creating the aesthetic, but when something doesn't do anything...!?!?
* Dustin: Tested in, so I hadn't done version control. Struggled to create my first repo, but two weeks later, I feel comfortable with checking out, switching branches, pulling, pusihing, committing every day. Around the terminal, VSCode Shortcuts.
* Marc: Loops have been the bane of my existence! (Ian: YES) Now I'm using them everywhere! In all my prototypes, loops within loops, and they work!? !? Getting those have been aha moments.
* Ian: With developer tools, it's so easy to test out CSS! You can just edit them in inspect, rather than going from VSCode, save, refresh. Adjust your content and boom! Imposter syndrome is actually really common?
* Matthew T: Don't be afraid to ask for help! Just talking through even with peers or a TA, guides in the right direction. Javascript does a lot!
* Mathieu R: The "Black Box" method of learning. I used that for loops to make them work, even though at the time I didn't understand what they were doing. Making it work, then figuring out how.
* Matthew S: The box model is actually kind of nice? I plan things out via blueprints, and then all the blank div tags to work as boxes for a set of elements. Planning those boxes guides the HTML&CSS & makes them easier.
* Diego: I love how we can use functions and loops to make our code DRY - like a 1000s lines of code turns to a couple hundred. If my code repeats 3 or 4 times, put it in a function!
* Mahad: The box model, and we can make things look cool using that & CSS.
